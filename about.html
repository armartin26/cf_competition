  <h1> Welcome to <b>ULAB</b>: Undergraduate Linguistics Association of Britain. </h1>
  <h2> The student run UK organisation for students of linguistics and related fields. </h2>
  <h3> <b>About ULAB</b> </h1>
  <p> In January 2011, Edinburgh Universityâ€™s Linguistics & English Language Society wanted to develop links with linguistics students in other universities. They searched for a national undergraduate linguistics group but soon realised there was a gap to fill: ULAB was born.</p>
  <p> We are a student run autonomous collective, and are entirely staffed by volunteers. We aim to: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Provide a forum for linguistics discussion among undergraduates in Britain; </li>
    <li> Hold annual conferences for linguistics students to present their work and showcase undergraduate research in language sciences;</li>
    <li> Provide a mailing list for issues exclusively in Britain;</li>
    <li> Help provide a network and central hub for university societies;</li>
    <li> Bridge the gap between national student interests and universities and professional organisations;</li>
    <li> Host an open-access blog to facilitate learning and self-presentation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Undergraduate Linguistics Association of Britain is the only society set up for undergraduate linguistic students that is not tied to another professional organisation or university. We are a subsidiary node of the International Association for Linguistics Students (IALS). </p>

  
  <h2> This year, ULAB is being hosted at The University of Edinburgh, 9th April to 11th April. </h2>
